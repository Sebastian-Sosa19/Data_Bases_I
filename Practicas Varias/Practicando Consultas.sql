-- Practicando consultas varias.

-- Base: BDEnterprise.
-- Consulta que devuelve el número de Tareas de cada usuario.
-- Obervaciones: ¿Por qué debo especificar un DISTINCT o de lo contrario me devuelve filas clonadas? ¿Cómo se influyen las clausulas WHERE y ON entre sí?
-- Saber que: la subconsulta devuelve un valor por la función agregada.
-- Captura: 001

    Here are three ways for resolving this query.
    In the first one, the subquery returns a value in the select list, a value that must match the employee number in the same select list, and must be grouped by the same value. In the second one, we use two subqueries in the from clause, one that retrieves the number of customers per employee, and other that retrieves the average amount for the sum of all the customers of each employees. The last one is a lighter form of the second one, since we don't complicate too much in the first subquery.
